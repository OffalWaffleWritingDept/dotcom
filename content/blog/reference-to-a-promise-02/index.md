She couldn't put off resting any longer; her aching body had discovered its limit. She ambled away from the road through a thick of wilderness to find a clearing with a single giant tree to provide shelter. The lion share of her kit was old camping gear. An unopened hammock, a collapsible chair, a sleeping bag, and half a case of water. Not much but she wasn't planning on staying out of doors much longer anyway.

She set up the chair and rested her swollen feet on top of the rest of her kit. The wind had been picking up as the darkness accumulated. The breeze was strong now and this was the first time she could appreciate it. Never before had she felt such thorough physical relaxation.

The melody of the breeze was making her tired. A twig _CRACK_ jolted her away from the dream that began as she nodded off. It was the irregular scurrying of leaves that followed the snap which worried her about what else might call this area home. She threw everything back into her kit bag to find the road again. It was as if all the relaxation were a blanket that slipped off as she rose and throbbing pain began pulsing up each foot. The respite helped so that she could make it a bit further but she knew she wouldn't last. Insecurity started eating away at her concentration. The soothing rustle of the breeze forced her to listen for any unwelcome guests.
