She felt the sun’s presence in the heat it left in the pavement that kept licking up her heels with each step. The ballerina flats didn’t help much. The old road was narrow and she hadn’t seen a car drive by the whole time she’d been on it. Not that a car ride would tempt her to turn back. She’d already reaffirmed her decision a thousand times over during the journey.

The sun dipped beneath the treeline and the humidity’s grip on her loosened. Two headlights announced the approach of a car heading her way. She wouldn’t have noticed except for hearing the short skid just as it passed her. She froze in her step and turned to see who this was and watched them throw it in reverse to get an answer for themselves.

Are you alright? Do you need a lift?

She waited for a pause to reply: No thank you. I’m heading out this way.

Are you sure? How much farther you got to go? Should you even be out here… walking in your… condition?

She looked down at her belly and placed her hand at its crown. Tears welled up in her eyes.

I’m real close to where I’m going, she lied. But thanks anyway. And she turned to make up for lost time chitty chatting, now with renewed determination.
