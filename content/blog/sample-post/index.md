# Oh hi!

Glad you were able to stop by. The idea behind this project is to start writing again. And in a way that's not, like, the easiest, but also not the most expensive. So I'm making it hard on collaborators and cheap for me!

## You wanna write something here?

Great! Well, I'm not really going to go into how you can do that just yet. I want to make a youtube about it. Can you say _youtube_ like a noun to mean video shared on YouTube? Surely you can.

Go to [Github.com](https://github.com) and create an account. A free one is all you need.

Next, heh, here's the fun part, go to [this website's repo](https://github.com/OffalWaffleWritingDept/dotcom) and make a new branch!

Next, create your post and save it. Commit it. Open up a Pull Request and then I'll get it merged <abbr title="As soon as humanly possible">ASAP</abbr>.

## Be right back with actual instructions... and a youtube.
